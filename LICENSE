Preamble

By using, modifying, or distributing this software, you acknowledge that you have made a series of questionable life decisions that led you to this moment. This license exists to protect both the original author's sanity and your own inevitable regret.

Terms and Conditions

1. Permission to Use
You are granted permission to use this software for any purpose, including commercial applications, provided you accept full responsibility for the psychological damage inflicted upon anyone who has to read, maintain, or debug code written with this abomination.

2. Distribution Rights
You may distribute this software freely, but you must include this license and a warning label stating: "This code may cause confusion, existential dread, and/or uncontrollable laughter. Use at your own risk."

3. Modification Rights
You may modify this software to make it even more cursed, but doing so automatically enrolls you in a support group for developers who have lost their way.

4. Attribution Requirement
If you use this software, you must credit "itsneufox" and include the phrase "I don't know how I got here" in your project documentation.

5. No Warranty Whatsoever
This software is provided "AS SUS" without warranty of any kind. The author is not responsible for:
- Code that compiles but makes no sense
- Debugging sessions that last longer than an amogus match
- Colleagues questioning your mental state
- Being voted out of your development team
- Spontaneous urges to rewrite everything in assembly

6. Limitation of Liability
In no event shall the author be liable for any damages, including but not limited to:
- Loss of productivity due to excessive memeing
- Carpal tunnel from typing "crewmate" instead of "new"
- Existential crisis about the nature of programming languages
- Being permanently banned from Stack Overflow

7. Support Policy
Technical support is provided exclusively through interpretive dance and amogus memes. The author reserves the right to respond to bug reports with "that's kinda sus ngl."

8. Termination
This license terminates automatically if you:
- Take this software seriously
- Use it in production without irony
- Fail to laugh at least once while using it
- Report bugs in a professional manner

9. Philosophical Clause
By using this software, you agree to occasionally stop and ask yourself "What have I done?" followed immediately by "Why am I like this?"

10. The Impostor Clause
If this software causes your code to become self-aware and start ejecting other programs, that's a feature, not a bug.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS SUS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

Remember: With great power comes great responsibility to question your life choices.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

This license was written during a moment of clarity that the author immediately regretted.
